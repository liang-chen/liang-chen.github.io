== About me
I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in Music Informatics at Indiana University Bloomington, advised by Prof. [http://music.informatics.indiana.edu/~craphael/ Christopher Raphael].\n
My research interest is to apply computational approaches and statistical models to address the problems related to the acquisition, analysis and processing of music data. Some specific projects include the scalable system for Optical Music Recognition (OMR), automatic music renotation from OMR, and expressive instrument synthesis. In essence, my research explores how to better combine the *technology* such as AI, Computer Vision and HCI, and the *music* to create useful and interesting applications.

I've created a thesis [https://github.com/liang-chen/PhDThesisTemplate latex template] to facilitate the people who may need to spend much time formatting their thesis due to the [https://graduate.indiana.edu/thesis-dissertation/formatting/doctoral.html official requirements] of our school.\n
